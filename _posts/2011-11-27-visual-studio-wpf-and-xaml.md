<p>The last time that I touched C# was about four years ago. I had just finished my first semester at <a href="http://njit.edu">NJIT</a> as a sophomore transfer, and I took a summer course with <a href="http://twitter.com/programmerdan">Daniel Boston</a> where we developed a payment gateway for the <a href="http://njitvector.com">Vector newspaper</a>. Since neither of us had ever used any of the .NET languages, and one of our requirements was that this had to run on a Windows server, we figured it would be a very good learning experience. We taught ourselves the ASP.NET and C# syntax in only six weeks, working tirelessly during the nights over Skype (we both had summer jobs), to complete our project on time and present it to the class. Needless to say, we succeeded, but got burned a few times by how much a pain in the ass ASP.NET was back then.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to get familiar with one of our developer tools at my day job, which is written with C# and WPF, and I have to say that I am quite impressed. Microsoft has identified a key point in the application development pipeline, and as far as I can tell, made a valiant attempt at solving it: the user interface should not be tied directly to the application (business) logic, and using WPF with XAML you give designers the ability to modify the layout of the application through the use of themes. This approach is very similar to how the web development process, through the use of HTML and CSS, allows for web designers to not affect the application logic that sits in the "backend."</p>

After a little searching it unfortunately looks like that the team behind Mono will not be supporting WPF in the near future. It would be nice to be able to use XAML and C# to quickly develop cross-platform applications which would use the native API for each platform. That means Aqua for Windows (Vista/7), Cocoa for Mac OS X and either Gnome or KDE for Linux/Solaris/Unix. Not to mention each time that I get a chance to use Visual Studio I feel like any other software development IDE pales in comparison, but I have felt that way for awhile now.</p>
<p>If you're interested in getting your hands into WPF 4.0, XAML, and the whole caboodle, head on over to <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> and pick up <a href="http://blog.adamnathan.net/">Adam Nathan's</a> <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/WPF-4-Unleashed-Adam-Nathan/dp/0672331195">WPF 4: Unleashed</a></em> which is the first programming book that I have seen that has high quality, full color, code samples. You won't be disappointed!</p>
