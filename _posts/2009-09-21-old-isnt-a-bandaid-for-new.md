As I have gotten older and older there have been less and less on
television that interests me to a point where I would call myself a
“follower” of a particular television show. While watching some
Saturday morning cartoons I ask myself: Were cartoons this horrible
when I was watching them years ago? But after doing some quick
mathematics (and remembering a little from economics) I am starting to
believe that due to the fact there are more and more channels
available the amount of quality programming goes down.

There has been a resurrection of television from when I was a kid. I
am starting to see older movies on television more often, the Cartoon
Network has been playing the older episodes of 'Scooby Doo' and it
seems that every week on television 'My Cousin Vinny' can be found on
one channel or another.

I have found my pleasure in 'House' on FOX, more recently 'Reaper' on
the WB and the 'Bionic Woman' on NBC. There were gambles taken with
'Firefly' (that proved to only gain a second life after the series was
canceled) and 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.' But the
television bigwigs are being way too cautious with programming and
refusing to take gambles with new ideas.

Even the movie industry is falling back on old franchises to bring
moviegoers back to the silver screen. Over the break 'Alien
vs. Predator' hit the screens near Christmas, 'Star Trek' had a teaser
trailer at the beginning of 'Cloverfield' and for the past six months
Sly has been all over the screen with 'Rambo.'

The executives of the major film companies would like to blame the
fact movie sales have been at all time lows due to piracy, but the
fact of the matter is that we don’t like purchasing a steaming pile of
shit. Even if the odor has been disguised the fact still remains: the
vast majority of movies lately have been crap.

Now, the fact has been obviously seen due to all of the re-makes,
spin-offs and reruns we seen on television and in
theaters. Unfortunately, the reason all comes down to the same thing
regardless of which industry: money. It costs money to produce a new
franchise that nine times out of ten wouldn’t yield the same result if
they just slapped another 'Star Trek' movie together with a big name
director attached.

I am tired of the same thing. Most of the innovation in the technology
industry comes from start-ups, research universities or rogue elements
of a bigger corporation. It all comes down to the little guy. When a
single person has a great idea, the perseverance and rolls the dice:
that’s when great things happen.

Hopefully a few good things come out of this Writer’s Guild
strike. One thing I would like to see are more gambles being taken
with relatively unknown writers. There are thousands of novels out
there with great stories that when I finish reading them I think,
“Damn this could totally be a great movie."

So I hope that the industry will stop making a debauchery of my
childhood. I am tired of seeing some half-assed adaptation of great
movies ('Alien vs. Predator' immediately comes to mind) and I am tired
of seeing the same television on all three hundred unnecessary
channels. We should all tell the entertainment industries to grow a
pair and stop blaming their lack of creativity on us.

If you have an idea for a story, short-film or series don’t be afraid
to tell other people. Get the word out and start filming some amateur
footage. Who knows, maybe you’ll be able to convince the idiots
spending millions of dollars on liquid feces such as 'Norbit.'
