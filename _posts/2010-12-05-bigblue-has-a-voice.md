<p>After several months of tinkering I have finally, successfully, gotten my hackintosh setup complete with working sound. Last night I got home from <a href="http://foodhack.eventbrite.com/">Food+Tech Hackathon</a> in SoHo and decided that I was going to make it my mission to get this heap in working order. After about an hour, a shower and some Jameson, the bad mamma jamma was running smooth like butter.</p>
<p>Some other not-so-awesome achievements was finally installing Outlook 2011 on my MacBook after being embarrassed because I was unable to open up a spreadsheet while working on <a href="http://milkhack.com">Milk Hack</a>. Which, in and of itself, deserves a little bit of explanation. I decided to go to this food hackathon hosted by the great <a href="http://twitter.com/dhgisme">Danielle Gould</a> and one of the ideas that was proposed was her own: to find get some visualizations in pricing information released by the USDA.</p>
<p>Now most of you that know me can attest that I absolutely hate the process of wrapping my head around statistics, but I love information and data hacking. Luckily enough I was joined by the R guru <a href="http://twitter.com/drewconway">Drew Conway</a> and what he was able to produce was a sweet animation that <a href="http://vimeo.com/17472997">we threw up on vimeo</a>. After pouring through several spreadsheets of data I then went to work on what is now the design of <a href="http://milkhack.com">http://milkhack.com</a>.</p>
<p>All in all it was a great day spent outside of the cold day in New York City. Big props go out to the <a href="http://gojee.com/">Gojee team</a> for hosting the event at their offices. I had a blast, met some great people and ate some amazing food. Who could ask for more?</p>
