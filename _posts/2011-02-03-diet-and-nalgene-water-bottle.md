For the past week or so I have been making an active effort in changing how much crap food that I eat. The problem is that there are very few "junk food" items that I eat, so cutting them out is actually a bigger pain in the ass than I originally thought it would be. But I decided (about a week ago) to start blogging about some of the items that I cook (and eat) for breakfast and dinner, hopefully each day, which will possibly force me into getting rid of those foods that ail me. 

Part of this whole change is to keep on a daily vitamin regimen and drink lots of water. As a software engineer I sit at my desk ten hours out of an eight hour work day. I answer emails, respond to tickets, and if I am a really lucky someone graces me with the time to write some code. When I first started at my employer I bought a rather large, washable plastic cup to drink water out of throughout the day. The problem with this is that, well, I drink a whole lot of water and sometimes this can get a little annoying. But the real issue is that I do not know <em>how much</em> water I am drinking a day because there are no markings on the cup to indicate that. 

So I started looking on <a href="http://amazon">Amazon</a> and found, what I believe to be, the perfect water bottle for the job. I was originally attracted to the <a href=""http://amzn.to/e4SNda>Nalgene "On The Fly" water bottle</a> because of the locking lid. One problem that I have had with some of my water bottles is that the lids, even though they have some fancy plastic push-lock mechanism, always seemed to wear out after a few months of use. This would lead to it not being reliable to put into the side sleeve of a backpack worry-free. Also, each and every single water bottle I have owned claims to be "leak free" but none of them have <em>ever</em> lived up to the test. 

I have only owned the Nalgen for a couple of days now, but the tight seal around the lip of the bottle actually makes me feel like this may be a long term winner. My previous water bottle finally broke after about a year of use (which is actually pretty damn good) but the problem with the <a href="http://amzn.to/fHfQ9s">Kor ONE</a> is that it is just so fucking <strong>big</strong>. It holds a 3/4 litre of water (or cola) [750ml] which is a whole lot of space! On the other hand the Nalgene caps off at about 650ml, is much smaller and the best thing: <em>has etchings on the side of the bottle to indicate how much water you are drinking!</em>. 

This post was going to go in a little more detail about my planned diet and vitamins, but I am looking at the time and realizing that I need to get my day started. So tonight I'll possibly write up some more posts outlining what my plan is.
