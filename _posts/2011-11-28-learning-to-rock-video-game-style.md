<p>When I was younger I spent a year or so not-so-admirably trying to learn how to play the saxophone. Like many people at that ripe age there were many other things on our mind: playing with friends outside, video games, and basically anything other than the prescribed homework-esque music. I can't remember actually ever understanding music, like most things in my life I think I probably guessed and slid through the class, but for some time I have always wanted to learn how to play music. I don't want to study music, in fact, I hate looking at it. It hurts my brain much in the same way that mathematics does, but that does not mean that I lack respect for music (and mathematics, for that matter).</p>
<p>When I first touched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&keywords=guitar%20hero&tag=thoughbanter-20&index=aps&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Guitar Hero</a> I thought it was very fun. My roommate and I spent hours upon hours staying up, not doing our class work, and battling each other with the game rifts. But it wasn't like playing a real guitar. I've strummed my digits, fumbled with the frets, but was never able to spend the time to actually learn how to play. This is where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&keywords=rocksmith&tag=thoughbanter-20&index=aps&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Rocksmith</a> enters the picture.</p>

We headed out that night and checked out Best Buy in hopes to figure out if we wanted to spend our hard earned money on some Black Friday swag when we first ran across Rocksmith. If that store in Reston, VA wasn't able to find an Xbox 360 controller I probably wouldn't have taken the red pill. My buddy, Drew, has been a guitar player for years and he was quite impressed with the game. Rocksmith <em>is</em> what Guitar Hero <strong>should have been</strong>. You plug in your guitar to the console, and strum along to the song with the actual notes, thereby learning how to play the song on the guitar. It is genius. Futhermore, Rocksmith includes video tutorials, a digital amp, and downloadable content to keep you rocking along for perpetually.</p>
<p>The game tracks your progress and will dynamically make the songs harder when your skill level increases (or easier when it decreases). This means that you will always be challenged, but not enough to get discouraged and put the instrument down when you can't feel that you accomplished something. Additional game modes allow you to master individual verses of the song, replay them at a slower speed, and even rock out to a friend that has purchased the game. Unfortunately, as far as we were able to tell, it does not include Xbox 360 (or Playstation Network) support for multiplayer, so your buddy has to actually come over to jam.</p>
<p>I've only been playing the game for a few days but I already know much, much more about playing the guitar than a did a few days ago. The obvious initial cost is a bit more steep than your normal video game if you don't own a guitar, but there are two avenues you can go: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050SYWGU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thoughbanter-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0050SYWGU">the bundle that includes a guitar</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JQW4HM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thoughbanter-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005JQW4HM">PS3</a>) [~$200]; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S5PBM0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thoughbanter-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004S5PBM0">just the game if you already have your axe</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S5TDL0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thoughbanter-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004S5TDL0">PS3</a>).</p>
<p>Since Drew and I stumbled upon an awesome Gamestop sale on the game, we were able to get it for about $25 dollars off the retail price, which allowed me to save about $40 off the price of the bundle when I went to Guitar Center to buy the instrument. But obviously if you already have a guitar, or are able to purchase one second hand, it would still be cheaper just to get the game in the box. It should work with any six string guitar, and future downloadable content to the game promise a setting for bass rifts. This was my late birthday present to myself, and I've been enjoying it for a few days now. I hope you're able to enjoy it, too!</p>
