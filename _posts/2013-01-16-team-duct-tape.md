At [Bloomberg][2] we've become amazingly efficient at pushing bytes
over the past thirty years. My role at [Bloomberg Government][1] has
changed over the past year that I have been down in Washington. At the
beginning of my tenure my job began with writing blazingly fast data
services to deliver legislative information for consumption by the
Ruby on Rails application. I then helped design and implement our
alerting infrastructure giving our clients the ability to define
custom legislative alerts tailored specifically to their search
criteria. The first six months at [BGOV][1] was a complete whirlwind
tour of software engineering, including project management, but in
August I was given the oppourtunity to completely change my role once
again.

Nowadays the sexiest problems to solve, for me, revolve around
distributed/parallel computing systems. We had a dire need to cleanup
our development and production infrastructure ranging from solving
disaster planning, continuous integration (rolling deploys) and
developer productivity. Anyone that has worked on a large team
understands the importance of keeping the machine well-oiled, lean and
fit. All of the moving parts need to be in sychronization to
continuously deliver the product to our customers.

So I am now a part of _Team Duct Tape_ at [Bloomberg Government][1],
keeping the lights on and the cogs moving. Software engineering is
about solving problems - big or small - in the most efficient way
possible. Look forward to some more technical posts regarding
datacenter disaster planning, orchestrating master elections with
Zookeeper and zero-downtime production deployment.
