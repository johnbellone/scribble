I will be heading off to the Boston Gameloop 2010 conference at the Microsoft NERD center in Cambridge, MA tomorrow night. I decided to travel by the means of the <a href="http://boltbus.com/">Bolt Bus</a> which provides both power outlets for laptops as well as free Internet for the trip. I am not quite sure the quality of either, but I expect to at least be online occasionally tomorrow night to chat on and off. I think I am going to take this time to work more on my <a href="http://typealoud.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> project, Type Aloud, which I am hoping to launch sometime around the beginning of October. I will be sending around some beta invites when the site is ready to rock and roll.
