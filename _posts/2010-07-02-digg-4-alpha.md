Let me say, the design and speed of the new Digg is simply amazing. It really shows how awesome a Cassandra backend can be. I'm glad to be choosing a NoSQL option for <a href="http://typealoud.com">my upcoming project</a>. 

Also, in order to add this feed I need to post this bad boy up - db998ce11c694408adff259cf458c5c4 - have a good holiday!
