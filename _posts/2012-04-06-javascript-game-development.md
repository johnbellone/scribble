About a week or so ago I came across a blog post which redirected me
to the [Mozilla's BrowserQuest project][1]. The [free multiplayer game][2],
which is completely built with web technologies, was introduced as a
demonstration of what we can expect to see in the upcoming years for
web-centric game development. BrowserQuest was developed using a
mixture of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript (client and server) to create a
multiplayer game that can be experienced wholly through an up-to-date
web browser.

The first few days that  I was trying to play the game Mozilla's
servers must have been swamped. I was unable to actually get beyond
the initial screen, but thankfully Mozilla posted the source code for
both the client and server, completely written in Javascript and
available on [Github][3], so I was
able to satisfy my technology curiosities. The past few years with the
introduction of more powerful, freely available, open source
Javascript engines such as Mozilla's own [SpiderMonkey][4]
and [Google's V8][5], have paved
the way for a language which is interoperable with C/C++ to be easily
embeddable and integrated with existing application systems. <a
href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js </a>was made available to quickly
build scalable event-driven servers that can power whole
service-oriented backends, and this is precisely the same technology
used in BrowserQuest.

This brings me back to my roots. When I was younger what brought me
into the realm of programming was both web development, and text-based
roleplaying games. Along with a few friends I ran what is commonly
referred to as a <em>MUD</em>, or Multi-User Dungeon, a small
application which ran on a remote machine allowing players to connect
over the Internet. This game was completely driven by text; movement,
combat, and storytelling were all expressed with text, sometimes an
emphasis using <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> font styles,
by the time that I got to the game coloring was available as well, but
the game itself was completely driven by imagination.

I can see myself getting back involved in a community developing a
game that is available for players to connect to, quest with their
friends, and being there to generally provide an escape, an
alternative, to the high-priced, resource demanding, massive
multiplayer games that exist such as <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>World
of Warcraft</em>. I can't wait to see what the development community
comes up with, and I hope that I find the time to participate in what
I believe to be the reemerging platform that will hopefully spark a
new generation of programmers willing to tinker, hack, and make some
awesome art.
