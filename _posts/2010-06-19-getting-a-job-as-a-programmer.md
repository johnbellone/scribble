My buddy, and fellow <a href="http://njit.edu">NJIT graduate</a>, noble prize laureat, open source developer, <a href="http://twitter.com/_kennyk_">Kenny Katzgrau</a> wrote up <a href="http://codefury.net/2010/06/how-to-get-a-job-as-a-programmer/">a great post on <em>How To Get A Job As A Programmer</em></a>. 

Anyone that may be interested in computer science as a major in college (or if you are already sitting in classes) that thinks they want to be a programmer may want to go read his little tidbit. If you're in college to become a programmer I am personally of the opinion that you've already missed your calling. Switch majors immediately. You should love this craft before you decide to make it a career.
