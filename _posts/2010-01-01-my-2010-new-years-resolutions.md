I hear that it helps to sometimes write down your New Year's
resolutions. Because I usually fail to complete most of my resolutions
I figure that I should receive all and any the help that I can get.

1. Exercise at least three times per week.
2. Lose thirty pounds.
3. Take more pictures.
4. Eat healthier.
5. Take a vacation.
6. Start writing a book.
7. Get involved in volunteer work.
8. Launch a website.
9. Enjoy life.
