There are times that I wish I could be addicted to something. While
hanging out with the local chumps I hear the war stories of people
that were an addict. There is nothing better than listening to someone
recount an experience that led them through the streets of
Philadelphia on a path of destruction to find that last little shit
who wants to sell him some crack.

Some of the world's fucked-up people are the people that interest
me. If you are crazy and hear voices in your head I want to know who
they are. Do they sound like Burt Reynolds or Sean Connery? I think it
would absolutely amazing to have the ominous voice of Charlie Manson
speaking to me at totally irrelevant times. How many people can say
that a serial killer talks to them while they are commuting to work?

I don't care who you are. You cannot tell me that you have not at
least once thought about what it would be to labeled clinically
insane. I'm not talking about slit-my-wrists-emo insane; I mean the
people that walk through the halls of Ancora eating crayons and
smearing Elmer's glue on their tongue. These are the type of people
that decide to mold their feces in the shape of the Pope, or weave a
blanket out of the hair that they had shed.

I am a firm believer that half of these people lie about these
craziness. It would be nice to be delusional and hear the voice of a
raving madman for a couple of minutes. Unfortunately I am not the type
of person to go through a drug induced stupor in order to hear a
second or third voice in my head whisper sweet-nothings into my
consciousness.

Obviously a vast majority of these people are crazy. But what about
the people that aren't? Maybe Elvis is really speaking to that a
random lunatic and all he wants is another peanut-butter and fried
banana sandwich. Who knows?

Oh what I would give to be crazy for a couple of hours. It might
answer so many questions in my life.
