At the beginning of each new year, like everyone else, I reflect
[on the previous][1]. The analytical part of my brain asks questions:
Did I achieve everything that I set out to? What was my barrier to
success? I don't _actually_ believe in the whole tradition of
resolutions - if I want to change something about my life I try to
live in the moment as much as possible - but it is always great to
have a plan for the future. So I'm going to step through some of the
decisions I made this year, and hopefully map out in my head what I
would like to achieve for 2013.

By and far the largest change had to be
[my change of roles at Bloomberg and relocation to Washington D.C.][2]
which was already in the works a year ago. I was getting disinterested
in my role in Equity Derivatives, and I wanted to get back into the
world of web products. I was lucky enough to land a role at
[Bloomberg Government][3] and took the option to move out of the
tri-state area to our nation's capital. I would be lying if I said
that this wasn't a carefully planned move. My whole life I lived in
New Jersey, and for a good portion of my adult life I commuted into
New York City. Like many people in my profession I had the itch (and
oppourtunity) to move to the west coast, but I didn't feel the need. I
was quite happy at Bloomberg, but I just needed a new _challenge_.

The move to Washington turned out to be the best choice I have made: I
met my amazing girlfriend Anna, a third-year law student at American
University; I got an [American Pitbull Terrier][4] puppy named Blue,
"Old Man Wrinkles"; went on a road trip to Tennessee this past summer
with Anna; dropped about twenty pounds; and I have found some awesome
places in Maryland to ride the Monster. There's much more to harp on,
but of course there's also some things that have happened that have
not been so great.

The first and foremost is being farther away from my family and
friends - albeit a two hundred and fifty miles - is definitely the
hardest to cope with. Trying to create a new homebase of friends is
definitely something I need to work on harder, and I took that for
granted while up north. This past summer I was diagnosed with sleep
apnea, which has likely afflicted me for several years now, and has
severely impacted my mental state. Aside from always being exhausted,
this illness has affected my mental state, and I have been struggling
with a bout of depression.

So now on to the good stuff. Here are some goals of mine, call it a
bucket list, that I wish to achieve in the upcoming year. I don't
pressure myself into this too much, but once again, its always nice to
be able to come back to something in the next year to see if my life
lead me to where I predicted.

* Take more vacation time. Travel overseas to Europe.
  I made this goal for the past two years and have not been able to
  deliver. This year I am planning on going somewhere for spring
  break - likely Cancun - but later in the year I would like to plan a
  trip to Europe. For awhile now I've had the ability to go, but never
  pushed myself to pull the trigger. I am not big on planning trips
  and I much rather prefer to either go somewhere with little more
  than a scheduled room. This obviously isn't a good idea on a limited
  time and money budget.

* Keep eating relatively healthy, but be much more active.
Last year I successfully dropped about twenty pounds which brings my
total to _sixty_ since I've began this change in life. At the
beginning of December I joined a local rock climbing gym, and up until
the past week I have tried to go a steady three times (per week) to go
bouldering. My goal this year is another twenty pounds which would
bring me to 217 but I wouldn't be against putting on some muscle.

* Write more words, and play more video games.
I failed horribly last year at writing. That's going to change this
year. I was able to catch up on playing some video games, but there's
still a huge back catalog that I need to sink some serious man hours
into.

* Read at least one book per month.
I actually did a fair amount of reading last year, and I only have
about a dozen or so books that I purchased and didn't get around
to. For anyone that knows me they know that I am a whore for
literature. Tell me that you wrote a book and I'll purchase it to read
at somepoint in the future. Possibly years. Seriously.

I haven't put graduate school back on the list because I am still not
sure what is for me. The logical half of me is telling me to go to
school for an MBA, but another part of me _really_ wants to go back
for a software engineering doctorate in distributed systems.

That's it for now.
