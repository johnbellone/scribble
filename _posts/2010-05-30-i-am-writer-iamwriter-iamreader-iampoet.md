For as long as I can remember writing has always been an intimate
experience for me. There is not a single day that goes by where my
mind does not wander, painting a story in my head involving the
strangers in my morning commute, an intricate plot that I sometimes
get a little carried away with. My weekly commute lets my brain get
back to a place where I feel like a child again, kick-starting my
imagination and providing more than enough to keep me awake throughout
the day. I find that not enough people in the world express themselves
with words. Some of us go through our lives and have never put a pen
to paper since high school. Those same people are the ones that have
never enjoyed a poem, let alone written one, and are the least likely
to walk into a book store for leisure.

The Internet has really given us a free outlet to express our
feelings. Be it [reading news][1], typing a few
[quips to followers][2] or sharing your life with
[long lost high school friends][3], we have taken our life and
digitized it. With "smart" phones that are now connected to the
Internet wherever we roam there is no longer a digital divide - we
live our lives with computers, no longer amongst them. We can embrace
this technology to become a better writer, poet and reader. You can
start by creating a free blog over at [Tumblr][4], like I have
[done for myself][5], which has an application that downloads right to
(most) mobile devices.

I believe that one of the solutions to this growing problem is to
identify yourself. If you are on your way into work on the train,
riding shotgun on a road trip, or sitting in a boring lecture,
scribble your thoughts down on a piece of paper and when you have a
free couple of minutes post them up on your blog. Make use of these
two hash tags, [#iamwriter][5] and [#iampoet][6], to let the world
know that you have not forgotten the imagination of your youth. Take
your words and post them up for all to see. When you are bored go take
a gander at some of the other writers all over the Internet and do
what [Krista Finch][7], and so many others are doing. Maybe a little
inspiration is all that they'll need as well.
