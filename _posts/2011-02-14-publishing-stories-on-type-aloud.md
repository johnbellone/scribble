One of the features that was omitted from the <a href="http://thoughtlessbanter.com/2011/01/17/type-aloud-beta-live/">Type Aloud beta launch</a> earlier this year was the ability to work on unpublished stories and chapters. My testing period in early December showed that the workflow of most of the users was to develop their story in some offline editor such as Word or Pages first, and then pasting in the finished product into the text area making slight modifications when needed for markup. 

A few friends brought this to my attention and this afternoon I started cooking up some changes to make it possible to "publish" and "depublish" stories and chapters from the website. Any story that is created first begins in an unpublished state (draft mode) which needs to be explicitly toggled by the owner before it goes live on the site. At any point in time the user has the option to take their story offline making it unpublished again. It <em>should</em> then immediately become unavailable across the site. I am working on making sure that comments and subscriptions correctly disappear when a story becomes unpublished as well. 

One good thing is that I do not plan on deleting subscriptions and comments on stories (chapters) when someone decides to depublish a story. This is assuming that the story will eventually come back because it was not deleted. When a story is deleted, the chapters, comments and subscriptions will follow.
