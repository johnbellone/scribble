Well, tomorrow is officially the day that Apple is going to update the iPad. Many of these tech blogging sites are wondering if we're going to possibly see a Thunderbolt (Light Peak) port on the iPad, or will we be seeing a SD card reader, perhaps dual cameras or how about that brand spanking new Retina display that the iPhone has been sporting for over a year? All of this shit would be absolutely great, but as someone that doesn't own an iPad (and doesn't plan on buying one in the near future, sans possibly developing applications) I am looking forward to one thing, and one thing only: the possibility that tomorrow we may finally see an iTunes cloud streaming service. 

It is a widely known fact that Apple has been purchasing some real estate in North Carolina to house a massive data center to what they've told investors is for their expanding cloud services division. For the past couple of years Apple has been trying to get people to pay $100 per year for <a href="http://me.com">MobileMe</a> when you can get the same services, with nearly the same Mac integration, for absolutely free from <a href="http://google.com/sync">Google</a>. Apple told its investors that this new data center is going to be strictly for MobileMe and iTunes; pray tell what exactly does iTunes need a billion dollar data center for on the east coast? MobileMe sure as hell doesn't need it; the service is crap, and most people only pay for it because they forget to take it off their credit card after the first three months they've owned a new Mac. 

Another point of interest is that Apple purchased <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/03/apples-lala-music-team-working-on-video-streaming-service-for-2/">Lala, a music streaming startup</a>, and has done absolutely nothing with the service to date. Steve Jobs sure as hell does not buy companies unless he plans on using their technologies, because otherwise they would just roll their own. You can bet your dollars that tomorrow we're going to see three things: a brand new iPad, without a Retina display, with two cameras, a bumped up processor and memory; a new take on the MobileMe offering, most likely free and including some kind of premium services ala Dropbox storage; and a cloud streaming service powered buy the Lala purchase. 

If we're lucky iTunes catalog streaming from the cloud. That would absolutely make my year. And I am about to launch a <a href="http://typealoud.com">a website myself</a>!
