title: Furniture For Men

tags: Life,Pennies For Thought
---
<p>A few months ago I got an apartment on my own, without a roommate, and found myself in quite a pickle: the only furniture that I owned as a living room coffee set, a few chairs that I acquired from the <a href="http://zinkkinc.com">Zinkk Inc office</a>, and some randomly assorted Ikea pieces. After putting out my desperate (not really) call to family (and friends) I started to search around for some local bargins because let's face it, why the fuck was I going to spend a lot of money on things to sit on in an apartment that I am barely at?</p>

<p>I did a little searching on <a href="http://etsy.com">Etsy</a> and found there were a couple of desks that I fancied, some badgering and trips to the local hardware store later I had a plan for a desk. I consider myself a very minimalistic person when it comes to furniture, sure it needs to look good, but ultimately all I care about is that it gets the fucking job done.</p>
<p>The choice was to build it with three eight food pieces of pine, and stain it to match as closely as possible to my living room set, since the desk would be at the center of the situation going on up in there. The legs were built from steel piping which was linked together with various elbows, unions, and fasteners, after being sanded down and painted with some rustoleum. Three two-inch holes were cut into the back of the desk to throw down some computer wires to allow the table to be flush up against the wall. A cross bar the length of the table would be used for stability.</p>

<p>After the success of the table I started to get drunk with power, and began dreaming up various shelving units, platform beds, that can be relatively easily be made with wood, steel piping, and a little bit of elbow grease. But before filling out an application for the Home Depot contracter's credit card there was something else that I wanted to try to get done with the scrap I had lying around.</p>

<p>A little over a year ago I sniped an auction on eBay and procured a traffic light for relatively cheap. At one point I was going to hack it with an <a href="http://hackaday.com/2010/01/05/arduino-traffic-light/">ardunio unit</a>, but after moving once or twice I thought it would be a lot better to turn this bad boy into a lamp. The only problem is that it weighs quite a considerable amount, and the stand itself would have to be quite beefy. While thinking out the table design the lamp stand was a natural second choice for the next project.</p>
<p>The planning stages are still underway, but I figured it would be approached in the same fashion: going to the hardware store, looking for some cool shit to throw together, and beginning the sanding, painting and piping. The only difficultly here is obviously the whole electricity thing, but I am pretty sure that I got that covered.</p>

A good buddy of mine suggested buying a <em>LoveSac SuperSac</em> which is essentially a memory foam bean bag chair. That's right, a 100 pound, 6 foot wide, bean bag chair. It is damn comfortable. As you can tell, my choice of a chair caused a lot of commotion on that website called Facebook.</p>
<p>The chair is micro-leather, which really means fake fucking leather that they can sell at a premium but is much easier to clean, and came packed into several different packages. You literally had to tear open the packaging, toss around the memory foam, and stuff the casing with this burlap sack full of lumpy foam. It was a huge pain in the ass, but in the end proved to be an perfect addition to the man-cave.</p>

<p>It definitely pays to have a little creativity (and a father with a garage full of power tools) and an open mind when you are looking at furnishing an apartment. This type of furniture probably does not suit everyone, but I have a particular taste which I think is highlighted quite well with the steel piping and stained wood finish. If the lamp goes as well as I hope my future projects will likely include a shelving unit for the kitchen to extend my "pantry," and I've already started looking at new ways to improve on the design of table (union screw locks, larger lengths of pipe). If anyone is interested I'm available for hire provided you have some beer and food.</p>
