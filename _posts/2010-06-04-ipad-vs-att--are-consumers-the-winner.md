I can be somewhat of am impulse buyer. This afternoon, after I was
reading more and more into how [AT&T][1] is pulling a bait and
switch</a>, I placed a few phone calls to the Apple retail stores in
and around New York City. I have been interested in purchasing a
device ever since I got a few minutes to play with the SDK, but what
nearly set me over the edge was the fact that [AT&T][1] has decided to
discontinue the unlimited 3G plan that Apple was still (up until this
afternoon) toting as one of the major selling points of the
device. What I found interesting is that all of the stores made a
point to tell me that <strong>all models</strong> of the 3G iPad were
currently <em>unavailable</em>, but all except the lauded Fifth Avenue
store had WiFi models for sale.

What I find the most interesting is how AT&T are parading this change
as being beneficial to their customers without providing any
statistics on data usage for the iPad. In the press release they
specifically stated that most users consume less than 2GB of
bandwidth, which so happens to be the ceiling of their data plans, but
the _will_ offer more bandwidth at a $10 per gigabyte rate after
that. I will agree with the AT&T findings - my bandwidth usage ever
since I have owned an iPhone (since the original) has never gone above
2GB - but I have a had time believing that a streaming Netflix program
won't regularly break that 2GB ceiling.

But a part of my questions if AT&T's motives, which absolutely are not
int the best interest of the consumer, are being put in place to
potentially curb a
[growing VOIP market with the release of Skype for 3G on the iPhone][2]. If
AT&T are able to make it more expensive to place VOIP phone calls then
people are not going to do it, right? In fact, what I find completely
insane is that these devices that have been heralded as the most
connected, interactive and innovative consumer electronics, ever, are
being hogtied by _the only capable wireless 3G provider_. We do not
have a choice even if we wanted to. These devices, even unlocked, will
not work with a similar 3G card inside due to the frequencies being
different between T-Mobile and AT&T.

So this unlimited data plan that was absolutely sold as being the
primary reason to purchase the 3G model of the iPad has, less than a
month after release, completely evaporated. Should those of us that
have purchased an iPad be up in arms? What about when AT&T decides to
change your contract when you use that neat little clause that lets
you turn off your wireless 3G service when you aren't using it - the
next time that you sign up are they going to let you pay $30 for
unlimited coverage? Boy, am I glad that Apple has decided to make the
iPad _unavailable until June 7th_, or else I may be asking those
questions myself right about now.

Oh, and by the way, if you want to tether your laptop to your iPhone
to use some of that 2GB of bandwidth that you have purchased from AT&T
you are going to have to pay an <em>additional</em> fee that will
*not* give you a higher cap. Anyone that is interested in voicing
their opinion directly to the man himself
[the Consumerist blog has posted the contact details of AT&T CEO, Randall Stephenson][3],
so have at it boys.
