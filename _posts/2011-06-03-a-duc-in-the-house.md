After talking with a few friends of mine, doing some research online, and a little more research in person, I decided that I knew what I wanted to purchase for my first motorcycle. The last time that I rode anything with two wheels that was not powered by my own legs was quite some time ago and it wasn't exactly what you'd call good practice for riding a motorbike. Because of this, and several people insisting that I should take the basic rider's course, I signed up to a riding academy a few minutes from my apartment in Jersey City. A few days after that I bought my Monster.</p>
<p>A friend suggested that I take a look at both the Triumph, and the Ducati brands. After some researching online I was pretty much sold on the Ducati Monster - the bike looked awesome, great reviews, and the price was right - so I went at the beginning of May to Cross Country Ducati in Metuchen to take a look at their Monster selection. After a little prodding, and some luck, I settled on a red Monster 796 (803cc) with Anti-lock brakes. About a week later the bike was delivered to my parent's house, and I went for some riding in the high school parking lot.</p><a href="http://thoughtlessbanter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_3663.jpg"><img src="http://thoughtlessbanter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_3663-300x199.jpg" alt="Front fairing on the Monster" title="Ducati Monster Fairing" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-771" /></a>
<p>I did the right thing by taking the basic rider's course, even though it was on Memorial Day weekend, a little over ninety degrees outside, and in Paterson. I was able to pass the examination and earn a waiver for my motorcycle endorsement, and on Tuesday I rode up to the DMV (twice!) and had it added to my driver's license. Before I left to head back up to North Jersey for work on Tuesday evening I took the bike out for a solo spin around town: I went up Nugentown road, Green street, Railroad avenue, Forge road, and all the way up Route 539 to the intersection of Route 72 (and back). Not too shabby. If all goes well I am planning on spending a lot of time riding this summer getting used to the Ducati, especially during the Gettysburg bike week at the beginning of July. So if you see me somewhere around make sure to give a thumbs up!</p>
<p>I also was able to get a telephoto lens relatively cheap for the digital SLR, and I plan to take some awesome photos of not only the bike, but where the bike takes me this summer. The ones that you see above were taken with the original, stock lens that came with the Rebel XTi. I am hoping to find a affordable wide angle lens for some more artistic shots.</p>
