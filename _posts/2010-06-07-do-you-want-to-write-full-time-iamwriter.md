I was reading a blog post today about how <a href="http://technorati.com/blogging/article/youll-never-be-a-full-time/">you'll never become a full-time writer</a> and even though I disagree, I find myself not enjoying the idea of needing to force myself to write hours on end in order to make a paycheck. For me writing is a hobby, it is something that I enjoy as it gives me a creative outlet, but I far more enjoy writing software as a day job. As the post points out many bloggers are "corporate suits" by day and "smartass bloggers" by night. Is this really a bad thing?

Sure you may have a small portion of yourself that wishes you could ditch your corporate job, sit at home all day and write opinion pieces for an online publication, but would you really be happy? For some of you that answer is a resounding <em>yes</em>, but for myself, the only way that I seem myself being able to be a full-time writer is if it were to be a novelist. As a blogger you are forced to have a shtick, either it being able to come up with witty one-liners for each and every post, be a complete and utter asshole to the point where people laugh at the obsurd  shit that you put out, or be able to write a complete story that flows beautifully. 

I am not a person that is consistant at any of those to be even considered an adequate candidate as a professional blogger. Of course I cannot say that I have ever tried doing so, but I think if that were my job I would end up falling back on writing software because that's what I enjoy to do. For some people blogging (and writing in general) is a dream that may eventually become more than a hobby, but for others, it is something that we enjoy in addition to our daily work grind. If it becomes more than that then we may decide to go with the flow, because really, that is all we can ever do anyway, right?
