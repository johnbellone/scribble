I have been using Wordpress for many years now. I firmly believe that
there is no better software available, free or paid, for rolling your
own blog. The guys over at [Automattic][1] are an amazing bunch of
people for giving away free software that might otherwise cost
thousands of dollars. But with all of that said I feel that there is a
big gap that the blogging community must hurdle in order to become,
well, more conjoined. When I am bored I tend to click around the
Internet, read some blog posts, and occasionally comment on the ones
that I feel are worthy. I have found that there is some great
[great commenting software out there][2] that allows tracking of
comments from site to site, but the same can't be said for blogging.

Now, I may have missed the memo, but what blogging really needs is a
centralized hub where I can easily search, comment and publicize the
authors that I think are making strides in the vast online writing
community that is the blogosphere. Up until this point I have had to
keep a list of bookmarks for the blogs that I want to frequent, but
why is that? Just as I am able to log on to [Digg.com][3] and given
stories that I would like to read, I should be handled blog articles
that are automatically aggregated utilizing the
[XML-RPC ping protocol][4] that Wordpress has seemingly kept
infamous. I believe that [the Wordpress.com community][5] is a step in
the right direction when it comes to a blog community, but I do not
want to be limited to having to open a blog on their host in order to
be listed there. Part of the reason I love Wordpress (the software) is
that I like the freedom I am given when I am able to run my own host.

Well, those are just some thoughts of mine. I am sure that someone,
somewhere, has been thinking the same thing that I have and is
probably already hard at work on the _next big thing_ when it comes to
blogging communities. I just have not found _anything_ that comes
close to my vision of what the ideal would be. Someone surprise me.
