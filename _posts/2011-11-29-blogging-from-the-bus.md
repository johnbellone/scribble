<p>I do not plan to make a frequent habit of this, but I had to try out the WordPress application for Android. The last time I remember using the mobile version was posting via an email sent to a special address that was set up for the blog. That particular medium for blogging wasn't half bad, but I found that formatting was less than stellar.</p>
<p>You can often tell that I do not go back and edit ny posts unless there is some kind of obvious oversight. Previously, I had cats like <a href="http://twitter.com/programmerdan">Daniel Boston</a> and <a href="http://codefury.net">Kenny Katzgrau</a> for that jazz, it wasn't my job in those days, and I don't really care for it now. Kudos to those two for taking my midnight ramblings and making them legible for newspaper print.</p>
<p>Lately I have been trying to get back to my roots as a writer, and entrepreneur, because I feel connected much more to those industries than where I see myself now. Ideally they would both intersect, with some code and software involved, but sometimes that's not what is in the cards for you. </p>
<p>I would love to be able to provide wisdom to today's youth with the coined phrase of "take the road less travelled," but I prefer to tell them to make money, get drunk, and party like a fucking rockstar. If anyone complains, screw them, you only live once, and be sure to write their asses off when you make your fortune.</p>
<p>Just remember that your fortune and legacy doesn't always need to be valued by your monetary worth.</p>
