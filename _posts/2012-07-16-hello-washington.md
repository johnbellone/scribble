For those of you that don't know, a few months ago I decided that it
was time to move away from New Jersey, and experience a different
atmosphere from the hussle and bussle of New York City. So I applied
internally at [Bloomberg][1] for a transfer to our Washington
D.C.-based [Bloomberg Government][2] product, and in the matter of a
_few weeks_ at the beginning of the year, I carted myself with all of
my possessions down to Northern Virginia.

Even though it was only a few hundred miles away from home taking that
initial leap was definitely hard. I was born, raised, and schooled in
New Jersey. I was part of [an amazing group of people][3] and
experienced the highs and lows of starting a business out of
college. All of my [close][4] [friends][5] [are][6] [all][7]
[still][8] living in New Jersey. But luckily I have a few contacts
down in D.C., and of course there's the new cats at [BGov][2] who are
keeping my quite busy.

To even further complicate my move, at the beginning of May after
being introduced to someone who had a litter of
[American Pitbull Terrier puppies][9], I decided to bite the bullet
and purchase one. The naming process was horribly unoriginal, and he
is named _Blue_ for being a blue-posed pitbull. In the photo he's
about ten weeks old, and very much enjoying his time being
photographed. Its really quite amazing everything you forget the years
since you've had a puppy.

I've been keeping busy trying all of the different cuisine available
around the area. Some favorites of mine were suggested by close
friends and colleagues: [Ray's the Steaks][10] in Arlington, VA is
probably the best steak I've had in a long time;
[The Italian Store][11] gives me sandwiches that rival even the best
places at home; [Shake Shack][12] has great burgers , beer and shakes;
[Nando's Peri Peri][13] is a chain, but still good eats.

And last but finally not least my girlfriend Anna has been showing
Blue and I the ropes of Washington while wrangling with the
responsibilities that go along with finishing up law school. Life
around D.C. would definitely be much more difficult if I didn't have
her company, and I've also been able to introduce her properly to New
York City and New Jersey. That's the _nice_ thing about only being a
few hundred miles away from home.
