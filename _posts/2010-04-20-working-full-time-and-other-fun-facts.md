It has been a few months since I have had the time to put in my few
cents on this blog. Since the beginning of January I have been working
for my new employer, [Bloomberg L.P.][1], first as an outside
consultant and finally full-time as a senior software engineer. After
accepting the six-week consultant position I was unsure if I would be
accept a full-time position, but after mingling with the crowd and
meeting a great group of talented programmers I was sold. So much to
my pleasure I was offered an amazing position working for the OTC
Equity Derivatives group in the Research and Development division at
Bloomberg.

One of my key deciding factors to accepting the position was the
fringe benefits; my graduate education would be reimbursed partly by
Bloomberg as long as my grades are kept high. So, with that, I am
going to be taking my Computer Science GRE very soon and applying to
NYU and Columbia University (both in New York City) to work towards a
Masters in Computer Science (specialization in software engineering).

I've _finally_ started work on my writing community project after
procrastinating for three long years. I picked up a Ruby/Rails book on
the recommendation of [JC][2] and absolutely enjoyed what I was
working with. So after many years of denying myself the time to spend
on learning Ruby I have dove in headstrong over the past week and a
half. My goal is to begin development this week and hopefully have a
prototype ready by the middle of the summer for public consumption
(see: beta). This project has been looming over my head ever since I
started at [NJIT][3] and I am glad to finally get my hands dirty.

Welp, that is about it for this short and quick update on my life. I
<em>want</em> to get into more of a blogging regimen as I have many
things to say, but unfortunately the time spent learning Ruby, with my
girlfriend and at the gym has left me exhausted by the time I sit down
at the computer at night. I am barely able to stay away through a full
episode of the flavor of the week on [Hulu][4]. But I promise (scout's
honor) to make more of an effort to ink more words.
