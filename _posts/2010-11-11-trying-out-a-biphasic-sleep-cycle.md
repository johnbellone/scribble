When I was in college we would inadvertently put ourselves into the situation where we would do this a lot; go to the classes during the day, spend some time with our friends and take a nap a little before (or after dinner). Later that night we would stay up until three in the morning either hanging out, writing code or playing video games. Of course at the time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">we did not know it was called a polyphasic sleep cycle</a> but nevertheless it worked for us.

Earlier this year I joined the working stiffs of New York City and could no longer do this because it just became too much. But yesterday I came across <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5302591/implement-advanced-siestas-for-improved-sleep">several</a> <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/forums/health-fitness/1638-switching-biphasic-sleeping-start-here.html">informational</a> sites which showed some promise in doing this. So after some time calculation the plan is that next week I am going to begin trying this out.

Basically how this works is that as soon as you get home, let's say around 7:30PM, you hit the sack and take a nap for about an hour and a half. At 9PM you should awake feeling quite refreshed and go on with your business until 2 or 2:30AM. At this point, at least for me, I plan on sleeping until roughly 7AM which will total approximately 6.5 hours of sleep per night. Most people average around the 8 hours per night mark which is a significant time sink when you extrapolate that across your life. Its quite absurd how much time we spend sleeping.

So, that's the plan. I'll keep this little "life hack" up-to-date as it progresses. From how it sounds I do not believe it will be much different than what I was doing in college (and in high school) which worked out nearly flawlessly. It may take a few days to get back into the groove of things.
