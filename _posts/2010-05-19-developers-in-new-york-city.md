This is for all of you guys out there that bust your ass and are
pissed off for those meat heads out in San Francisco getting all of
the press.

After attending the Yahoo Open Hack event last October, meeting some
amazing individuals, I have decided that the fun needs to happen more
often. For those of you that do not know exactly what Yahoo Open Hack
was about, essentially you stick a bunch of geeks with computers in a
room for twenty-four hours, supply pizza and booze, and see what they
produce in the end. I have spoken with some of my local hombres, but I
need some more people to make this thing happen. I can provide some
networking equipment, a few Unix servers, but I am going to need
someone access to some awesome hacking space in New York City for an
overnight weekend shindig.

If you are interested, know someone who is willing to provide the
space or merely want to weigh in on the subject matter drop a
comment. I am looking to hold this event during the summer, with a
follow up one right before the [Web 2.0 Expo][1] in September. As of
right now there is no cost associated with this project other than
what it will cost you to live in New York City for a night (which,
depending on your lifestyle may be a hell of a lot).

Let's get this ball rolling people.
